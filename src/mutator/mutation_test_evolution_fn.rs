/// Performs a basic evolutionary step to generate the next population of individuals.
///
/// This function implements a straightforward genetic algorithm to evolve a population
/// using selection, crossover, and mutation. It is intended as a foundational operation
/// for population evolution processes.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `assign_pos`: A slice of indices representing mutable positions in the symbolic trace.
/// - `prev_population`: A slice of the current population of individuals.
/// - `prev_evaluations`: A slice of evaluation scores corresponding to the individuals
///   in the population. Higher scores typically indicate better fitness.
/// - `base_base_config`: Configuration parameters used for verification or mutation.
/// - `mutation_config`: Configuration parameters controlling mutation and crossover rates,
///   as well as the size of the new population.
/// - `rng`: A mutable reference to a random number generator used for probabilistic operations
///   like crossover and mutation.
/// - `trace_mutation_fn`: A function that applies mutation to an individual. It takes
///   a mutable reference to an individual, the base verification configuration, and
///   a random number generator.
/// - `trace_crossover_fn`: A function that performs crossover between two parent individuals
///   to produce a child individual. It takes two parent references and a random number generator.
/// - `trace_selection_fn`: A function that selects a parent individual from the population based
///   on their evaluation scores. It takes a slice of individuals, their evaluations, and a random
///   number generator.
///
/// # Returns
/// A `Vec<T>` representing the next generation of individuals after applying selection, crossover,
/// and mutation.
///
/// # Type Parameters
/// - `T`: The type representing an individual in the population, which must implement `Clone`.
/// - `TraceMutationFn`: A callable function type for mutating an individual.
/// - `TraceCrossoverFn`: A callable function type for performing crossover between two individuals.
/// - `TraceSelectionFn`: A callable function type for selecting individuals based on fitness.
///
/// # Algorithm
/// 1. For each new individual in the population:
///     - Select two parent individuals using `trace_selection_fn`.
///     - With a probability defined in `mutation_config.crossover_rate`, create a child
///       by applying `trace_crossover_fn` to the parents. Otherwise, clone one parent.
///     - With a probability defined in `mutation_config.mutation_rate`, apply `trace_mutation_fn`
///       to the child.
/// 2. Collect all generated individuals into a new population.
