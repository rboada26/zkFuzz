/// Mutates a trace by replacing a randomly selected position with a new random constant value.
///
/// This function introduces randomness into an individual's trace by selecting a position and replacing
/// its value with a newly generated constant, based on configurable probabilities and value ranges.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `individual`: A mutable reference to a `Gene` (a mapping of position in a trace to symbolic values),
///   representing the mutation of the trace.
/// - `_base_config`: A reference to the `BaseVerificationConfig`, which is currently unused in this function
///   but might be relevant in future extensions.
/// - `mutation_config`: A reference to the `MutationConfig`, specifying the value ranges and probabilities
///   used for generating random constants.
/// - `rng`: A mutable reference to a random number generator (`StdRng`) for producing random values.
///
/// # Behavior
/// - If the `individual` is not empty:
///   - A position is selected randomly from its keys.
///   - The selected position's value is replaced with a new `SymbolicValue::ConstantInt`,
///     generated using `mutation_config.random_value_ranges` and `mutation_config.random_value_probs`.
/// - If the `individual` is empty, the function does nothing.
///
/// # Notes
/// - The generated constants are drawn according to the probabilities and ranges defined in the `MutationConfig`.
///
/// # Future Considerations
/// - `_base_config` could be leveraged to introduce additional constraints or behaviors during mutation.
